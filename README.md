# React + TypeScript Boilerplate

This project provides a ready-to-use React application scaffolded with Vite and TypeScript. It includes linting, formatting, and testing tooling so you can focus on building features immediately.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server.
- `npm run build` – type-check and create a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint on TypeScript and TSX files.
- `npm run test` – run the Vitest test suite once.
- `npm run test:watch` – run tests in watch mode.
- `npm run format` – check formatting with Prettier.
- `npm run format:write` – format files with Prettier.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Run tests when needed:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

Adjust configuration in `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, or `.eslintrc.cjs` as required for your project.
